  # Hermes — Nous Research's agentic assistant.
  # https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs
  #
  # WHY container mode (not the native systemd service):
  # Hermes is an *agent* — it runs shell commands, does browser automation
  # and installs its own tools at runtime. The module's `container.enable`
  # runs the whole thing inside a mutable Ubuntu OCI container (Nix-built
  # binary bind-mounted read-only from /nix/store), so:
  #   - a rogue tool call is boxed in the container, not on the NixOS host
  #   - the agent can pip/npm/apt-install freely inside that box (the native
  #     mode is immutable and those would fail)
  #   - config still lives here, declaratively.
  # Backend is podman to match the rest of genghis (system/profiles/x86/
  # containers.nix); native mode would also pull in docker, which we avoid.
  #
  # WHY no GPU flag: Hermes does no inference itself — it points at the
  # existing llama.cpp OpenAI endpoint on the host (:8080/v1). The 3090 Ti
  # stays entirely with llama.cpp. (Add `--gpus all` under container.
  # extraOptions only if you later want Hermes doing its own GPU work,
  # e.g. local whisper STT.)
  #
  # Secrets (the placeholder API key llama.cpp requires) live outside the
  # nix store at /var/lib/hermes/env. Create once:
  #   sudo install -d -m 0700 /var/lib/hermes
  #   echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-local-unused' | sudo tee /var/lib/hermes/env
  #   sudo chmod 0600 /var/lib/hermes/env
  #
  # NB: Nix/NixOS is a Tier-2 ("best-effort") target for Hermes and this
  # module is young — after adding the flake input, sanity-check the exact
  # option names it exposes with:
  #   nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.genghis.options.services.hermes-agent \
  #     --apply builtins.attrNames
  # and adjust below if any differ from the docs.
